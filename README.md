# saleor-checkout

Extensible, checkout and payment integrations powered by Saleor API.

## Setup

This monorepo uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager and [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) for building packages.

### Monorepo structure

Here's the list of each app and shared package in the monorepo (click to see a README of that project)

#### Apps

- [`apps/saleor-app-checkout`](apps/saleor-app-checkout/README.md): a Next.js Saleor app with dashboard for managing settings and theme, backend for Checkout, and the Checkout Storefront – ready to be extended/modified
- [`apps/checkout`](apps/checkout/README.md): an SPA React 18 checkout app, currently deprecated (kept for backward compatibility)

#### Packages

- `packages/ui-kit`: UI kit for checkout and [React Storefront](https://github.com/saleor/react-storefront)
- `packages/config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `packages/tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `packages/checkout-storefront`: Checkout store front component
- `packages/checkout-common`: Common types and utils

### Install dependencies

```
pnpm i
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm run build
```

You can also build a specific app or package by running this command:

```bash
pnpm run build --filter=checkout
```

In this example, we'll only build `apps/checkout`

### Develop Saleor App

Create a tunnel for `saleor-app-checkout`:

```bash
cd apps/saleor-app-checkout && npx saleor app tunnel 3001
```

> Note: the process needs to be running in the background

Before you start the server, you need to change default environment variables. Create `.env.local` file in each app:

- [`apps/saleor-app-checkout`](./apps/saleor-app-checkout/README.md#env-variables)

To run the development server for all the apps, use the following command:

```
pnpm run dev --filter=saleor-app-checkout...
```

### Develop Checkout Storefront

When in dev, a special development server is also running for `checkout-storefront` on port 3002. Check out [localhost:3002?checkout=<ID>](http://localhost:3002?checkout=) and add the your token to the url.

### Other

You can also run only a specific app by running this command:

```bash
cd apps/checkout && pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

### GraphQL Schema

To generate GraphQL code based on latest schema from Saleor instance defined in `SALEOR_API_URL` env variable run this command:

```
pnpm run generate
```

You need to run this command after each change in `*.graphql` files

### Env variables

Change environment variables inside `.env` file:

- `SALEOR_API_URL` — GraphQL endpoint of your Saleor

  Example:

  ```
  https://my-env.eu.saleor.cloud/graphql/
  ```

  > To run sandbox Saleor environment in [Saleor Cloud](https://cloud.saleor.io/) use this command:
  >
  > ```bash
  > npx saleor project create && npx saleor environment create
  > ```
  >
  > You can also run Saleor locally. See [Saleor docs](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/installation) for more instructions

- `CHECKOUT_APP_URL` — URL of deployed Checkout App

  Example:

  ```
  https://saleor-app-checkout.vercel.app
  ```

  > See [guide below](#vercel) on how to deploy the Checkout App

There are more environment variables available in each app. Go to their README's to learn more

Payment gateways can be configured in the Checkout app inside Saleor dashboard.
Go to **Apps > Third party apps > Checkout**.

You can toggle, which payment gateway handles each different payment options per channel:
